#Temperature Database

Temperature Database is a C++ program designed to manage and analyze temperature data. It utilizes a linked list data structure to store temperature records and provides functionalities to load data from a file, output data to a file, and perform queries.

File Structure:

    main.cpp: Main program file responsible for orchestrating the execution of the temperature database.
    TemperatureDatabase.h and TemperatureDatabase.cpp: Files containing the implementation of the TemperatureDatabase class, which manages the temperature records and performs database operations.
    LinkedList.h and LinkedList.cpp: Files containing the implementation of the LinkedList class, which represents a linked list data structure used to store temperature records.
    Node.h and Node.cpp: Files containing the implementation of the Node class, which represents a node in the linked list containing temperature data.
    TemperatureData.h and TemperatureData.cpp: Files containing the implementation of the TemperatureData struct, which represents temperature data including location, year, month, and temperature.

Functionality

    Load Data: The program loads temperature data from a specified file into the database.
    Output Data: The program outputs temperature data from the database to a specified file.
    Perform Query: Part 2 of the program - The program performs queries on the temperature data based on specified criteria.
